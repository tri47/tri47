Hi, this is <span class="red-text" style="font-size: 16px"> **Tri**</span> ('tree'). I am a DATA GEEK based in <span class="red-text">**Melbourne, Australia :coffee:**</span>. 

My mission: to make it a bit easier for people and organisations to find <span class="red-text">**facts that matter**</span> to them.

Visit my blog - [scatta.cc](https://www.scatta.cc) for my writings on data visualisation, NLP and digital products.

I have worked as a <span class="red-text">**Data Analyst**</span>, a <span class="red-text">**Business Analyst**</span>, and an <span class="red-text">**Engineer**</span> at Telstra, Service Stream, Spectrum Engineering and CSIRO. My bachelor degree was in Engineering from [**ANU**](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I also study part-time for a Master in Data Science at [**Georgia Tech**](https://www.gatech.edu/) :school:. Go Jackets :honeybee:!

While not at my desk, I enjoy bouldering , Judo, hiking and strategy board games.
