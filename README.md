Have we got something in common? I worked as a Developer and Engineer at Telstra, Spectrum Engineering and CSIRO. My bachelor degree was in Engineering from [**ANU**](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I am also studying part-time for a Master in Data Science at [**Georgia Tech**](https://www.gatech.edu/). Go Jackets :honeybee: :honeybee:

While not at my desk, I enjoy bouldering, Judo :muscle:, hiking and strategy board games.
