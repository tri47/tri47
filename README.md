Hi, this is <span class="red-text" style="font-size: 16px"> **Tri**</span> ('tree'). I am a DATA GEEK based in <span class="red-text">**Melbourne, Australia**</span>. My mission is to make it a bit easier for people and organisations to find <span class="red-text">**facts that matter**</span> to them in a perflexing, connected world. 

Visit my blog - [scatta.cc](https://www.scatta.cc) for my writings on data visualisation, NLP and digital products.
