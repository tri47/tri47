Hi, this is <span class="red-text" style="font-size: 16px"> **Tri**</span> ('tree'). I am a **data geek** based in <span class="red-text">**Melbourne, Australia :coffee: :coffee:**</span>. 

**My mission:** to make it a bit easier for people and organisations to find <span class="red-text">**facts that matter**</span> to them.

Visit my blog - [scatta.cc](https://www.scatta.cc) - for my writings on data visualisation :chart_with_upwards_trend:, NLP and digital products.
